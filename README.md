# ChatGPT Prompts

Here are two cases where I have used ChatGPT to assist with some of the things I do.

#### One is helping to craft narrative summaries for faculty evaluations.
Twice a year I evaluate about twenty faculty. They turn in portfolios and lists of their activities, which I then have to write up summaries of their efforts across a dozen categories. With ChatGPT I can just cut-and-paste statements, listed, names, etc. and it can then turn all of the input into a brief narrative summary.

Here are some examples using the OpenAI playground: [Faculty Evaluations]( https://github.com/brownt47/ChatGPT_Prompts/blob/main/Evals.md)
