## Examples of using ChatGPT and prompts for writing evaluations of faculty members

#### Using ChatGPT to turn statements into a narrative summary

Here it takes a few statements and turns it into a narrative summary, yet it is a little too complimentary. 
Since this is an evaluation of the past year, it needs to be in the past tense too.

### Adding some more instructions to the prompt

Here we add "Do not Compliment" and "Write in past tense". That seemed to tone down ChatGPT's complimentary nature and it is in past tense now. Notice how it replaces "I" with the faculty members name. Also it includes a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) reference when it detects the Black History Symposium comment.

### Using ChatGPT to expand acronyms for professional organizations:

Faculty typically just list the acronyms for all the organizations and conferences they attend. Which I have to type out the full name which is a bit time consuming when doing this for twenty-plus evaluations. 
Overall, it performed great at this task. A few times it would get a word or two wrong in the full name of organizations. It still saved a lot of time typing these out.

### Hallucinations

Here it detects the names of a few students who the faculty member wrote letters of recommendation for and decided to add an additional student.
While it can be appreciated trying to make the faculty member look better, one still has to review the output.

#### ChatGPT prompts for responding to student discussion posts

When having to respond to hundreds of student discussion posts every week, it gets difficult to provide unique replies for each student. To just reply "Thanks for posting" does not give an impression that the instructor actually read the post. Using ChatGPT, it can be prompted to provide a reply that responds to topics mentioned by the student. Prompts can also include reminders and encouragements. Some examples:

```
Respond to the studentâ€™s discussion post.
Keep it brief: 100 words
Echo back some of the topics discussed.
Provide a statement of encouragement on the upcoming final exam.

Out of the 10 tips from Andrea Hendricks, I resonated the most with tip number 6. This tip is to focus on getting started. 
I typically get easily overwhelmed at the beginning of every week, leading me to procrastinate (number 10). 
However, if I focus solely on getting started, I always complete more assignments in one sitting. 
This is much like the five-minute rule I started practicing a few semesters ago. This is a cognitive-behavioral 
technique that is designed to increase productivity. Essentially, you only commit five minutes to the task and 
are free to stop after those five minutes. Through this, I have learned that I go far beyond the five minutes 
and will even work hours at a time. I believe these ten tips are essential to a 
'''productive semester and will be used to finish strong.

Hi Lily,

I'm glad to hear that you have found a technique that works for you in getting started on assignments. Tip number 6 is definitely important; if we can just get started then the rest often follows. I also believe the other 9 tips provided are essential for staying productive and motivated this semester. Good luck with your upcoming final exam!

Best wishes,

Timothy Brown, Instructor
