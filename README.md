# ChatGPT Prompts

Here are two cases where I have used ChatGPT to assist with some of the things I do.

#### One is helping to craft narrative summaries for faculty evaluations.
I assess approximately twenty faculty members twice a year by reviewing their portfolios and activity lists. Afterwards, I am responsible for summarizing their achievements in twelve different categories. Thanks to ChatGPT, I can easily copy and paste statements, organization names, and conference attendance details from their portfolios. ChatGPT then transforms this information into a concise narrative summary.

Here are some examples using the OpenAI playground: [Faculty Evaluations]( https://github.com/brownt47/ChatGPT_Prompts/blob/main/Evals.md)


#### Another is crafting unique replies to students discussion posts on various assignments.
In my classes, students are given weekly discussion tasks that involve reading articles, watching videos, sharing study techniques, and similar assignments. As the instructor, I respond to each student's post to ensure regular and meaningful interactions. ChatGPT has been helpful in managing the hundreds of posts I receive each week and ensuring that my responses are unique and relevant to each student's contribution.
