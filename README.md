## Examples of using ChatGPT and prompts for writing evaluations of faculty members

#### Using ChatGPT to turn statements into a narrative summary

Here it takes a few statements and turns it into a narrative summary, yet it is a little too complimentary. 
Since this is an evaluation of the past year, it needs to be in the past tense too.

### Adding some more instructions to the prompt

Here we add "Do not Compliment" and "Write in past tense". That seemed to tone down ChatGPT's complimentary nature and it is in past tense now. Notice how it replaces "I" with the faculty members name. Also it includes a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) reference when it detects the Black History Symposium comment.

### Using ChatGPT to expand acronyms for professional organizations:

Faculty typically just list the acronyms for all the organizations and conferences they attend. Which I have to type out the full name which is a bit time consuming when doing this for twenty-plus evaluations. 
Overall, it performed great at this task. A few times it would get a word or two wrong in the full name of organizations. It still saved a lot of time typing these out.

### Hallucinations

Here it detects the names of a few students who the faculty member wrote letters of recommendation for and decided to add an additional student.
While it can be appreciated trying to make the faculty member look better, one still has to review the output.
