# ChatGPT Prompts

Here are two cases where I have used ChatGPT to assist with some of the things I do.

#### One is helping to craft narrative summaries for faculty evaluations.
Twice a year I evaluate about twenty faculty. They turn in portfolios and lists of their activities, which I then have to write up summaries of their efforts across a dozen categories. With ChatGPT I can just cut-and-paste statements, listed, names, etc. and it can then turn all of the input into a brief narrative summary.

Here are some examples using the OpenAI playground: [Faculty Evaluations]( https://github.com/brownt47/ChatGPT_Prompts/blob/main/Evals.md)


#### Another is crafting unique replies to students discussion posts on various assignments.
My classes have weekly discussion assignments where they are to read an article, watch a video, share their study techniques, and other similar assignments. I then reply to every student post so that there is regular and substantive interactions between the instructor and the students. ChatGPT helps me having to respond to hundreds of posts each week and making sure each post is unique and relavant to what the students said in their post.

Here are some examples from using API calls [Student Discussion Replies](https://github.com/brownt47/ChatGPT_Prompts/blob/main/Students.md)
