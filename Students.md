## ChatGPT prompts for responding to student discussion posts

When having to respond to hundreds of student discussion posts every week, it gets difficult to provide unique replies for each student. To just reply "Thanks for posting" does not give an impression that the instructor actually read the post. Using ChatGPT, it can be prompted to provide a reply that responds to topics mentioned by the student. Prompts can also include reminders and encouragements.

Here are two examples from an assignment where students are asked to watch the Ted Talk given by Dr. Angela Lee Duckworth on "Grit".

#### Example 1
Here was a post were the student seemed a little down on themselves. The response acknowledges this tone and offers some encouragement.
```
Respond to the student’s discussion post.
Keep it brief: 100 words.
Echo back some of the topics discussed.
Be encouraging.

Today I know my family would tell me I'm grit, but I don't believe I am. My family sees that I have goals in life that 
Im working toward which is true, but I know that Im not working toward my goal efficiently, and I don't have 
the motivation and tend not to put in that much effort. At the moment, mentally and physically, I'm not where 
I should be, and I know that affects my motivation to strive for more. Thankfully I do understands what it 
means to fail and learn from mistakes.

To be a successful student, I must have a goal, steps, or milestones to achieve that goal and never give up. 
Success takes effort and motivation, a drive to keep pushing no matter what, and learning to adapt to new things.

Response:

Hi there! I understand that your family sees you as a gritty person because you have goals in life that you are 
working towards. However, it's okay if you don't see yourself that way. It's important to remember that grit is 
not just about having goals, but also about persevering through challenges and setbacks. Keep working towards your 
goals and don't be too hard on yourself. You got this!

#### Example 2
Let's look at another example where some specific hardships are brought up by the student and how ChatGPT can offer some encouragement.
It detects the mention of children and echoed that point, while adding in the idea that adults can benefit from this too.

Grit to me seems like a form of motivation that one self has to have or obtain.
Grit isnt something that is taught but developed through behavior good and bad. 
It isnt based off whos the smartest, most talented, or looks. Grit works off of passion and the 
will to not give up. My definition of what it takes for students to be successful is exactly that, 
not giving up . Not giving up is the number one drive and key to success. Learning to be ok with 
failure because not everyone strikes out on the first try. Success also is not giving up when things 
are going good. Soon as we do good we can get too relaxed. I agree with Angela Lee Duckwork on getting
kids more gritter.I also think it should and can apply to adults. With having children myself,I think
it is important for kids to develop a sense of passion or drive. When you do find that drive its
always a reminder or a push to keep going.As billie Jean  King states- "Champions keep playing 
until they get it right."

Response:

I completely agree with your definition of success and your idea that it's important for kids to 
develop a sense of passion and drive. Grit is a powerful tool that can be developed and honed over time, 
and it's something that will help kids (and adults) become successful. I think it's important for kids 
(and adults) to remember that success often comes from persistence and determination.

Out of the 10 tips from Andrea Hendricks, I resonated the most with tip number 6. This tip is to focus on getting started. 
I typically get easily overwhelmed at the beginning of every week, leading me to procrastinate (number 10). 
However, if I focus solely on getting started, I always complete more assignments in one sitting. 
This is much like the five-minute rule I started practicing a few semesters ago. This is a cognitive-behavioral 
technique that is designed to increase productivity. Essentially, you only commit five minutes to the task and 
are free to stop after those five minutes. Through this, I have learned that I go far beyond the five minutes 
and will even work hours at a time. I believe these ten tips are essential to a 
productive semester and will be used to finish strong.'''

Response:

Hi Lily,

I'm glad to hear that you have found a technique that works for you in getting started on assignments. 
Tip number 6 is definitely important; if we can just get started then the rest often follows. 
I also believe the other 9 tips provided are essential for staying productive and motivated this semester.
Good luck with your upcoming final exam!

Best wishes,

Timothy Brown, Instructor

Indeed, all the tips highlighted are very relatable and useful and would lead to high proficiency in my opinion.
However, the Pomodoro technique resonated with me more than the other ones. 
I usually do this when I am performing time-consuming tasks but I used to think it is a bad indulgence. 
Reading through these tips reassured me that my practice is truly helpful. 
I will definitely use this method in subsequent studies.

Response:

Hi Thomas,
I'm glad to hear that the Pomodoro technique has been helpful for you! 
It's great to have a tool like this in your arsenal. All of these tips are useful and should 
prove helpful as you study for your upcoming final exam. Good luck - I know you'll do well!
