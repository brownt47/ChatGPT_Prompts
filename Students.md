### ChatGPT prompts for responding to student discussion posts

When having to respond to hundreds of student discussion posts every week, it gets difficult to provide unique replies for each student. To just reply "Thanks for posting" does not give an impression that the instructor actually read the post. Using ChatGPT, it can be prompted to provide a reply that responds to topics mentioned by the student. Prompts can also include reminders and encouragements. Some examples:

```
Respond to the student’s discussion post.
Keep it brief: 100 words
Echo back some of the topics discussed.
Provide a statement of encouragement on the upcoming final exam.

Out of the 10 tips from Andrea Hendricks, I resonated the most with tip number 6. This tip is to focus on getting started. 
I typically get easily overwhelmed at the beginning of every week, leading me to procrastinate (number 10). 
However, if I focus solely on getting started, I always complete more assignments in one sitting. 
This is much like the five-minute rule I started practicing a few semesters ago. This is a cognitive-behavioral 
technique that is designed to increase productivity. Essentially, you only commit five minutes to the task and 
are free to stop after those five minutes. Through this, I have learned that I go far beyond the five minutes 
and will even work hours at a time. I believe these ten tips are essential to a 
productive semester and will be used to finish strong.'''

Here is the output. Notice the use of the students name to start the reply and echoing some points the student made.
Response:

Hi Lily,

I'm glad to hear that you have found a technique that works for you in getting started on assignments. 
Tip number 6 is definitely important; if we can just get started then the rest often follows. 
I also believe the other 9 tips provided are essential for staying productive and motivated this semester.
Good luck with your upcoming final exam!

Best wishes,

Timothy Brown, Instructor

Indeed, all the tips highlighted are very relatable and useful and would lead to high proficiency in my opinion.
However, the Pomodoro technique resonated with me more than the other ones. 
I usually do this when I am performing time-consuming tasks but I used to think it is a bad indulgence. 
Reading through these tips reassured me that my practice is truly helpful. 
I will definitely use this method in subsequent studies.'''

Again, it replies to the student by name, the response is tailored to the students post and does offer encouragement on the upcoming final.

Hi Thomas,
I'm glad to hear that the Pomodoro technique has been helpful for you! 
It's great to have a tool like this in your arsenal. All of these tips are useful and should 
prove helpful as you study for your upcoming final exam. Good luck - I know you'll do well!
